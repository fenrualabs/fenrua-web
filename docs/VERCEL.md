# Vercel Publishing

Canonical production domain: `fenrua.ai`

Canonical Vercel project: `fenrua-web`

Node runtime: `24.x`

## Project Settings

Use these settings for the existing Vercel project:

- Project: `fenrua-web`
- Framework preset: `Other`
- Root directory: repository root
- Node.js version: `24.x`
- Install command: `npm ci --omit=dev`
- Build command: `npm run build:release`
- Output directory: `public` (generated deterministically by the release build)
- Production branch: `main`
- Production domain: `fenrua.ai`

The Vercel Git integration supplies the checked-out, approved commit as
`VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_SHA`. Enable Vercel's system environment variables for Git
builds. The generated public release
manifest binds only the listed public static artifacts to that source commit;
it never prints credentials, project identifiers, or protected operational
data.

## Domain

In Vercel, open the project, go to **Settings -> Domains**, and add:

- `fenrua.ai` as the canonical production domain
- `www.fenrua.ai` as an alias; the committed host-specific redirect sends every
  `www` request permanently to `https://fenrua.ai`

Do not add project IDs, organisation IDs, credentials, tokens, or other project
internals to this repository.

## Notes

`vercel.json` keeps clean URLs, security headers, cache headers, the current
`/audit` route, and redirects for superseded `/genesis` and `/regression`
routes. Release evidence is limited to the public static artifacts listed in
the generated release manifest; it does not attest to protected systems or live
block-card data.

Do not add analytics, pixels, session replay, remote embeds, or third-party
tracking scripts.

The site provides access-only technology services through tiered subscriptions
and client-specific business agreements. See the
[access-only commercial boundary](ACCESS_ONLY_COMMERCIAL_BOUNDARY.md); this
repository must not describe a token, investment, exchange, trading, or
financial-return product.

## Validate From WSL and Publish Through Git

Use Node 24 from a clean checkout of the owner-approved `main` commit. The local
command validates the release but does not deploy it:

```bash
npm ci
npm run release:production-check
```

After review, merge or push that exact approved commit to the protected `main`
branch. The existing Vercel Git integration deploys it to `fenrua-web`; Vercel's
system `VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_SHA` binds the remote build to the source revision.
The repository deliberately has no Vercel CLI dependency. Browser testing stays
outside the Vercel build because Vercel installs production dependencies only.

After deployment, observe the public static artifact set without writing to
the deployment:

```bash
RECORD_SHA256=$(node -p "require('./.well-known/fenrua-release.json').integrity.recordSha256")
npm run audit:live-release -- --url https://fenrua.ai --expected-commit <40-character-commit> --expected-record-sha256 "$RECORD_SHA256"
```

Retain that command's receipt with the release record. It is an observation at
a point in time, not an assertion about live cards, APIs, protected systems, or
future alias state.

## Rollback and external cleanup

If the public audit fails, re-promote the last passing production deployment.
The owner has approved removal of every prior deployment and alias associated
with `fenrua.ai` or `www.fenrua.ai`; retain only the audited canonical
production release. Keep `www.fenrua.ai` only as a permanent redirect to
`https://fenrua.ai`, never as a second content site. Do not record credentials,
server-environment values, or other protected project internals in this
repository.
