## Changes

- Toolchain route now publishes exact server-rendered delivery counts and defensible derived taxonomy.
- Chain telemetry now exposes primary-source, independent-source, and confidence language without leaking endpoints.
- Verify route links a complete result corpus.
- Developer route includes clean-checkout bootstrap commands.
- Research records expose full review fields.
- Evidence registry includes provenance and copyable citation.
- Status route separates operational state from maturity.
- Legacy public estate routes are archived and noindexed.

## Boundaries

Contract evidence remains pending. No wallet, presale, FENswap, legal-policy, runtime-gate, policy-engine, hosted-verifier, reserve, bytecode, or production-certification claim is introduced.

## Validation

Run:

```bash
npm run generate:static
npm run validate
```

Deployment should be performed only after the branch is pushed, reviewed, and promoted or merged according to the release path. The contract-evidence boundary remains unchanged.
