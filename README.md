# fenrua-web

Canonical static Protocol Explorer for `fenrua.ai`.

## First Evidence Link

- [Security Audit Log](docs/SECURITY_AUDIT_LOG.md)

This repo is a standalone website for Fenrua Labs and the `fenrua-kernel`
evidence surface. It uses plain HTML, one CSS file, a local SVG asset, and one
local JavaScript manifest for status hydration.

Collaboration contact: `partnerships@fenrua.ai`.

## Canonical Website

`fenrua-web` is the canonical public website for Fenrua Labs. Production
publishes through the existing Vercel project `fenrua-commons`, which owns
`fenrua.ai`.

## Utility Standard

- `fenrua-kernel` is the bedrock research artifact.
- `fenrua-web` is the reproducible protocol interface.
- Releases are identified by evidence commit, not marketing name.
- `bedrock-source` and `evidence-commit` stay separated for future releases.
- Do not claim "Certified" or "Formally Verified" until the math is complete
  and external audits are signed.

## Local Validation

No build step is required.

Open `index.html` directly in a browser, or serve the folder with any static
file server.

Use Node 24 for validation and publishing:

```bash
npm run validate
```

## Tracking Policy

Do not add Google Analytics, Hotjar, pixels, remote embeds, or any other
tracking scripts. If traffic data is needed, use raw server logs from the host.

## Production Domain

Publish through Vercel with `fenrua.ai` as the production domain:

```bash
npm run deploy:production:node24
```

The typo-safe alias also works:

```bash
npm run deploy:prodction:node24
```

See [Vercel Publishing](docs/VERCEL.md).
